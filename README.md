How to build the docs
---------------------

To build the docs, you must install [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/), the [Solarized Pygment](http://gthank.github.io/solarized-dark-pygments/), and then run the following commands from Terminal:

    cd path/to/Craft-Docs/source
    sphinx-build -b html -a . path/to/build
