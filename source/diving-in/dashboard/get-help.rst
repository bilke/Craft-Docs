Get Help
====================

The Get Help Dashboard Widget allows you to send a support request to Pixel & Tonic directly from the Craft home-page.  This form will include your Admin email address, a location for a description of your issue, the Craft version and build, and optionally (as a checkbox) error logs and a database backup.  Including this information allows us to expedite your support ticket and get you targeted help.
