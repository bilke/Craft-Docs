| Sometimes bad things happen to good software… don’t let that slow you down.                                                                                                                       | |gethelp| |

| The Get Help Widget allows you to open a support ticket with `Pixel & Tonic <http://pixelandtonic.com>`_ directly from your dashboard.                                                            |           |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                   |           |
