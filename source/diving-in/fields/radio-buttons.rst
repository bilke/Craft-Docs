Radio Buttons
=======

The Radio Buttons fieldtype allows you to create a grouping of Radio Buttons to include on your publish form.

You can set an Option Label, a Value, and check if that option is the default value.  You can also drag and drop your checkbox items to control the row order presented when modifying content.
