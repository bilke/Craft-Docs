Table
====================

The table fieldtype allows you to create a dynamic form to add content to a previously unspecified number of rows.  You can set the Column Heading, Handle, Width, and Type.  For the type of content, you may select from:

* Single-line text
* Multi-line text
* Number
* Checkbox

And you may set default values for the row to be populated with when entering content.
