Plain Text
==========

The Plain Text Field Type allows you to create a simple textarea for storing content.

You can optionally set “Hint Text” that will be shown if the field doesn’t have a value on the entry page.

There are also optional settings to set a limit on the maximum number of words or characters allowed in the textarea as well as whether to allow line breaks in the textarea.
