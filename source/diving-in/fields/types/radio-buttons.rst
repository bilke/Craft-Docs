Radio Button
============

The Radio Buttons Field Type allows you to create a grouping of Radio Buttons to include on your Entry form.

You can set an Option Label, a Value, and check if that option is the default value.

You can also drag and drop your checkbox items to control the row order presented when modifying content.
