=======================

Craft needs some basic email information for its outgoing emails.  You can set this up in Settings > Email.  There are 2 basic settings:

* System Email Address: The email address Craft will use when sending email.
* Sender Name: The "From" name Craft will use when sending email

Craft uses PHPMail as the default protocol, additionally Craft offers the Sendmail, SMTP, POP, or Gmail protocols for sending system emails.
