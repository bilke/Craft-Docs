Thanks for checking out Craft! We’re extremely thrilled to be getting it into your hands, and we hope you’re excited too.

State of the Docs
-----------------

This branch is undergoing major revisions.

The documentation is by no means complete yet, and we’re constantly adding more to it.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or find an error, please `email us <mailto:support@buildwithcraft.com>`_, and we’ll look into it right away.

The source of the docs is also up on `GitHub <https://github.com/pixelandtonic/Craft-Docs>`_. Feel free to fork them and submit changes via a pull request.
