Blocks Docs Home
================

Thanks for helping us test out Blocks! We’re extremely thrilled to be getting it into your hands, and we hope you’re excited too.

State of the Docs
-----------------

The documentation is by no means thorough at this point. Fleshing them out will be one of the primary focuses throughout the duration of the beta. Expect them to get better and better as time goes on.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or find an error, please post on `Blocks Support <https://support.blockscms.com/index.php?pg=request&xCategory=1>`_, and we’ll look into it right away.
