Entries
=======

Entries store content in your Craft based site.  

Entries belong to :doc:`sections <sections>`. They contain the following properties:

* Title
* Slug (if the section is set to give entries their own URLs)
* Author (if the Users package is installed)
* Post Date
* Expiration Date
* Tags
* Status

Entries also get whatever :doc:`fields <fields>` were selected by their sectionâ€™s :ref:`field layout <fieldLayouts>`.
