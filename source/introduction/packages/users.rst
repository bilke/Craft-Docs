Users
=====

If you’re operating something more than a personal site and need multiple user accounts, the Users package is for you. Its features include:

* Multiple user accounts
* User permissions
* User groups
* Public user registration

Here’s a breakdown of what you’ll get:

* A new “Users” link within Settings where you can manage user groups, profile fields, and global user settings.
* A new “Users” tab in the CP where you can see all of the users in the system, organized by user groups.
* Two new tabs within user settings: “Profile” and “Admin”. Profile includes a User Photo setting as well as any custom profile fields defined in Settings → Users → Fields, and Admin contains settings for setting user groups and permissions, and whether the use is an Admin. User info and the ability to suspend/reinstate users can also be found in the Admin tab.
