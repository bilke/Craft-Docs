Sections
========

:doc:`Entries <entries>` in Blocks belong to **sections**. The feature set surrounding sections differs greatly depending on whether you have the Publish Pro package installed or not.


Without Publish Pro
-------------------

If you don’t have Publish Pro installed, you only get one section, called “Blog”. It does not have any customizable properties; everything is hard-coded. The only thing you have control over is its :doc:`content blocks <blocks>`. To edit those, go to Settings > Blog.


With Publish Pro
----------------

If you do have Publish Pro installed, you can manage your sections by going to Settings > Sections. From there you can edit existing sections and add new ones. Each section gets the following settings:

* Name
* Handle
* “Title” Label
* Whether entries in this section have their own URLs
* Entry URL Format
* Entry Template

The last two settings only show up if you have opted to give entries in the section their own URLs.

Each section gets its own unique set of content blocks, which can be edited from the “Blocks” tab within a section’s settings.
