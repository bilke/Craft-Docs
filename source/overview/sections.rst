Sections
========

:doc:`Entries <entries>` in Craft belong to **sections**.

You can manage your sections by going to Settings > Sections. From there you can edit existing sections and add new ones. Each section gets the following settings:

* Name
* Handle
* “Title” Label
* Whether entries in this section have their own URLs
* Entry URL Format
* Entry Template

The last two settings only show up if you have opted to give entries in the section their own URLs.

Each section also gets its own :ref:`field layout <fieldLayouts>`, which defines which fields will be available to its entries.

   **Note:** If you do not have Publish Pro installed, Craft is limited to only one section.
