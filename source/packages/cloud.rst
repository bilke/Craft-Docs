Cloud
=====

If you want to connect your Craft site to assets stored in the cloud, look no further than the Cloud package. Its features include:

* Amazon S3 support
* Rackspace Cloud Files support (Coming soon)

Here’s a breakdown of what you’ll get:

* A new “Type” setting when editing an Asset Source, with the options “Local Folder” and “Amazon S3”. Choosing “Amazon S3” will replace the File System Path and URL settings with S3-specific settings: Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Bucket, Subfolder, and URL Prefix.
