=========================

Craft comes pre-wired for five different extended feature packages which can be purchased right within the app. They are:

   :titlesonly:

   publishpro
   users
   cloud
   rebrand
   localize

To purchase packages, go to Settings → Packages from the CP. There you can see each package listed along with its features. Packages you’ve purchased will have the option to install/uninstall, and packages you haven’t purchased will have the option to purchase.

Clicking the “Buy” button will open a modal window where you can purchase the package right from within the app.

	**Don’t worry!** Purchasing packages from within the app has been made secure, even if you’re not accessing Craft over a secure connection. See :doc:`secure_payments` for more details.

We have intentionally made the packages fit right into the core app experience, so using package-added features is indistinguishable from the core features.

In this section, we outline exactly what each package adds.
