Publish Pro
===========

Publish Pro transforms Craft from a simple blogging tool into a “real” CMS. Its features include:

* Multiple content sections
* Entry drafts and versioning
* Section user permissions (when paired with :doc:`users`)

Here’s a breakdown of what you’ll get:

* A “New Section” button at the bottom of Settings → Sections which allows you to add additional sections.
* A list of all available sections in the sidebar of the Entries index, allowing you to filter entries by section.
* A dropdown menu when clicking the “New Entry” button on the Entries index page, where you can choose which section you want to create a new entry in.
* A dropdown menu beside the title of the entry allowing you to switch between viewing the current version of an entry, passed versions, and any existing drafts of that entry.
* A “Save as Draft” button beside the “Save” button when editing the current version of an existing entry.
* When editing a draft of an entry, the “Save” and “Save as Draft” buttons will be replaced by “Save Draft” and “Publish Draft”.
* User permissions will appear for every section, including two new permissions specifically dealing with editing/publish other users’ drafts (if :doc:`users` is also installed)
