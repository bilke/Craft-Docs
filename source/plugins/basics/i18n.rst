Internationalization
====================

Craft makes it extremely easy to define translatable strings. From PHP, just wrap the string in ``Craft::t()``, and from the templates, just run the string through the ``|t`` filter. Craft will take the string and check if it has been translated into the user’s preferred language.

If your string has a dynamic portion to it, such as “Ingredients in a {cocktail}”, where “{cocktail}” should be replaced by the name of the cocktail you’re currently viewing, just pass a second parameter to ``Craft::t``:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   namespace Craft;

   $str = Craft::t('Ingredients in a {cocktail}', array(
       'cocktail' => $cocktail->name
   ));

You can do the same thing within your templates with the ``|t`` filter:

.. code-block:: html

   {{ "Ingredients in a {cocktail}"|t({
       cocktail: cocktail.name
   }) }}
