Templating
==========

In Craft, all HTML rendering is done via **templates** (even for the Control Panel itself). There are no PHP-based view files.

Templates are files that live within your craft/templates/ folder. The structure of your templates is completely up to you – you can put templates at the root of that folder, or you can nest them in subdirectories. It all depends on your site’s needs.

Craft uses `Twig <http://twig.sensiolabs.org/>`_ to parse your templates. For a primer on Twig’s templating syntax, read through their `Twig for Template Designers <http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/templates.html>`_ documentation.
